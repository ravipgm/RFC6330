=======

An Implementation of the FEC code as specified in IETF - RFC 6330. This implementation is simple and works fine for small values of K. It can be improved for larger K values later. The implemented encoder and decoder is tested with the test vectors specified in the section 6.3 in the document provided in the link http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/tsg_sa/WG4_CODEC/TSGS4_69/Docs/s4-120717.zip .
